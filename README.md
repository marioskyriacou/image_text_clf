**Image Text Classification with SGD Classifier******
This project aims to classify text within images using a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier. Given an input image containing text, the system extracts the text from the image and classifies it into predefined categories using machine learning techniques.
**Overview**
Text classification in images is a challenging task due to variations in fonts, sizes, orientations, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. This project utilizes computer vision techniques for text extraction and an SGD classifier for classification.
